# Solving-Rubik-s-Cube-3x3-Using-Computer-Vision
This is the final project of the Computer Vision subject. First, Use HSV colorspace to detect the color in each cell of the Rubik's cube. Next, the position of the color cell will be sorted to fit with the Rubik solver library. Finally, arrowed instructions will be displayed on the Rubik's to help the user rotate until finish the task.
This is my video to show the result of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppxXLxMviws&t=17s
